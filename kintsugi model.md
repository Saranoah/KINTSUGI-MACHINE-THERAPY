## 🏔️ Key Insights

**The Kintsugi Principle:** Each crack becomes a golden seam of wisdom. The neural network doesn’t just recover from errors—it transforms them into enhanced learning pathways.

**Progressive Beauty:** Notice how `Scar Beauty` grows from 0.000 to 0.602, representing the accumulation of wisdom through adversity.

**Resilience Growth:** The journey from 0.690 to 0.891 resilience shows the strengthening effect of properly processed challenges.
